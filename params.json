Create your template, it won't be rendered\r\n2. Decide where it belongs\r\n3. Prepare the template with some data\r\n4. Insert the prepared template into the DOM\r\n\r\n## install\r\n\r\n### npm\r\n\r\n `npm i --save utemplate`\r\n\r\n### git\r\n\r\n`git clone git@github.com:Announcement/utemplate.git`\r\n\r\n## usage\r\n\r\n### head\r\n\r\nIt doesn't *have* to be in the head, put it wherever you want, just make sure it's loaded before the script is run.\r\nWe chose this location because if you don't have a `<head>` and `<body>` tags, most parsers throw the `<template>` in there by default.\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<template id=\"message\">\r\n  <article>\r\n    <h2>{title}</h2>\r\n    <p>{message}</p>\r\n  </article>\r\n</template>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n### body\r\n\r\nThis is where we're going to put it for all to see\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<section id=\"messages\">\r\n</section>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n### script\r\n\r\nFirst, let's generate a new *Template* from our previously defined element.\r\n\r\nNote that this can use the following provided by **Alchemist**\r\n\r\n- [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)\r\n- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) node\r\n- HTMLElement\r\n\r\n~~~ javascript\r\ntemplate = new Template(\"#message\");\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNext, we need to provide some data.\r\n~~~ javascript\r\ntemplate.pipe({\r\n  title: 'Hello, world!',\r\n  message: 'How are you today?'\r\n});\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nAnd decide what to do with it.\r\n~~~ javascript\r\n// attach it to the DOM (now via a querySelector)\r\ntemplate.pipe('#messages');\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n## frequently asked questions\r\n\r\n### That's nice, but why is it useful?\r\n\r\nIn the real world, data is going to be from a source.\r\nMy environment has a couchdb document, but yours can be whatever you want it to be\r\n\r\n- avoid writing *html* inside of *javascript*\r\n- don't `document.createElement` or `document.createTextNode` by hand\r\n- no more writing stringified json to the document.\r\n\r\n### Where does my data come from?\r\n\r\nThe properties directly correspond to the text inside of the template and are automatically filled with those keys.\r\n\r\nAs of version **utemplate@1.1.0** they can be multiple levels deep such as `{a: {b: {c: 'd'}}}` and the template requests `{a.b.c}`\r\n\r\n### Why wouldn't I use Angular, Meteor, or something *better*\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy reading and learning new things, then those will probably better for you. But if you want something small, fast and want it to just work, then microTemplates are for you.\r\n\r\nOurs is very small and easy to learn, so if you're a *beginner* (or a *minimalist* like myself), then you should **definately** start here.\r\n",
